#1 About

This project is a mapping project for Atys, the world of Ryzom (https://ryzom.com).

It provides alternative maps which give a more detailed view of the areas than the default maps provide. In that
sense use of these maps may be considered spoiler as it reveals information about the landscape and passages which
is not readily or as easily available ingame (though by no means this contains inaccessible or priviliged information.
All information is or can be obtained through ingame discovery and carefuly note-taking).

All maps individually or everything together can be downloaded from: 
https://cloud.planetmaker.de/index.php/s/qf6JcWao6fNxmmx

Usually each map will carry the date stamp of its last revision (see also the changelog below). Current events
might change some maps and invalidate information.

This project is released under CC-BY-SA v4.0 (see LICENSE.txt).
The project is drawn in GIMP and the original layered GIMP files are made available occasinally on
https://github.com/planetmaker/ryzom-maps
